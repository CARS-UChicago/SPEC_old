-  The standard spec macros are
   /usr/lib/spec.d/standard.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/scans.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/scans1.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/psic.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/kappa.mac

-  Note that these macros are replaced when spec is re-installed
   therefore dont edit these files or the changes will be lost

- The below macro files are not replaced during a new installation 
  and can be used for defining/replacing macros
      /usr/lib/spec.d/site_f.mac        (read only when starting fresh)
      /usr/lib/spec.d/site.mac          (read each time each user starts)
      /usr/lib/spec.d/fourc/conf.mac    (or sixc, spec, kappa, etc.)
      ./spec.mac              (relative to start up directory)


- The following macro files have been created:
      
1.  /usr/lib/spec.d/site.mac
    # User macro file
    qdofile("/home/specadm/user_macros/site_user.mac")

    Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/site_user.mac
    to add/replace standard macros (note this file is read 
    each time spec is started)


2.  /usr/lib/spec.d/kappa/conf.mac
    # user macros specific to kappa
    qdofile("/home/specadm/user_macros/kappa_user.mac")

    Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/kappa_user.mac
    to add/replace macros for kappa


3.  /usr/lib/spec.d/psic/conf.mac
    # user macros specific to psic
    qdofile("/home/specadm/user_macros/psic_user.mac")

    Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/psic_user.mac
    to add/replace macros for psic


-  Note before defining a macro type lsdef in spec to see
   if the name is already defined


################# Notes on User defined macros ########################

- To use traj scanning type traj_scan_on in spec, to turn it off
  type traj_scan_off

-  Setting up the amptek detector 11-01
   To use the epics defined mca roi set these
   mca_par("disable",0)      # enables the mca (this is default value)
   mca_par("soft_preset",1)  # resets the mca when counting
   and check the user_getcounts macro in site_user.mac

   To use the mca roi through the scaler turn off the mca in spec
   mca_par("disable",1)  # disables the mca
   and turn the mca on in epics with an infinite real time!!!
